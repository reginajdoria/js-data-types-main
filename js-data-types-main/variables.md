# Introduction to JavaScript: Variables

According to the MDN docs "A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name."

One analogy to describe variables is like a box. You can put lots of things into the box, like a
doll, rug, or cat. You can change what the box holds.

This analogy can help get the initial understanding of a variable, but I find it's a bit too much of a simplification and makes it more difficult to understand more complication scenerios. I like to think of a **Variable** as a label with a wire pointing to a value. The connection always starts at the label and ends at the value. This wire allows you to refer to that particular value by a custom name later in your code.

We use variables to help repeat, change, store, or edit our data.

In order to **declare** a variable in JavaScript we use the keywords `var`,
`const`, or `let`. The original declaration keyword was `var`, but in newer
versions of JavaScript `const` and `let` were implemented. `const` is used on
variables that will not be changed in your JavaScript code. `let` is used for
variables that do change.

Most of the time, we want our variables to immediately point to a value (a label isn't very useful if it doesn't point to anything). Therefore, we **assign** values to our variables when we declare them.

We can create a variable without assigning it a value, if we want. This would be
like having a label that doesn't point to anything.

```js
let noValue;
console.log(noValue);
// => undefined
```

Here are three examples of variable assignment and declaration at the same time.

```js
let favoriteFood = "Chocolate";
console.log(favoriteFood);

let greeting = "hello ";
console.log(greeting);

const greetingEvvie = greeting + "Evvie";
console.log(greetingEvvie);

```

When we declare a variable using `let` or with the old keyword `var` we
can update our variables:

```js
let noValue;
console.log(noValue);
// => undefined

noValue = "assigned now";
console.log(noValue);
// => 'assigned now'


var favoriteNumber = 12;
console.log(favoriteNumber);
// => 12

favoriteNumber = 100;
console.log(favoriteNumber);
// => 100

```

But you can NOT reassign a variable declared with `const`

```js
const mobilePhone = 'iPhone';

mobilePhone = 'samsung';
console.log(mobilePhone);
// => Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

JavaScript is a "dynamically-typed" language, meaning a variable can switch
between data types. The following change is valid.

```js
var myFavoriteNumber = 5;

console.log(myFavoriteNumber);
// => 5

myFavoriteNumber = "five";

console.log(myFavoriteNumber);
// => "five"
```

## Variable Syntax (5 minutes / 1:25)

### Semicolons

- Semicolons can be put at the end of each line.
- We recommend using them consistently throughout this course!

  - [Hacking Semicolons (by Evan You who wrote Vue.js)](http://slides.com/evanyou/semicolons#/)

### camelCase

JavaScript variables and function names are case sensitive. You can write them however you want, but they're conventionally written using camel
case syntax.

- First letter of first word lowercase
- First letter of remaining words uppercase
- No spaces or punctuation between words

#### Examples

```js
const pizzaTopping = "pepperoni";
const isThisVariableCamelCase = true;
const hasURLChanged = false;
```

Because Javascript is case sensitive, it helps to be consistent in your naming conventions.

```js
const pizzaTopping = "pepperoni";
console.log(pizzatopping);
// Uncaught ReferenceError: pizzatopping is not defined
```

> Note: Other types: kebab-case, which separates words with dashes, and snake
> case, which uses underscores.

Use kebab case for CSS classes. CSS is essentially case-sensitive, so
this-class-name is much easier to read (and type!) than thisClassName.

snake_case is used in programming languages like Python.

> You don't have to follow camelCase standards, you could just UPPERCASE
> EVERYTHING. But it's a good idea to be consistent everywhere, especially
> when working with other developers.

### Comments

Comments are an extremely important part of writing code. They help us make
sense of our code, especially for other people reading our code, or when we have
walked away from some code and have completely forgotten what certain sections
of it do. This happens much more quickly than you may imagine.

If you are working on a team, your documentation and commenting practices often
translate to how easy you are to work with!

```js
// Single line comment

/*
  Multiple
  line
  comments
*/
```

There is a short cut for commenting something out. To comment out a single line,
click anywhere on the desired line and hold `command` and press `/`. The same is goes
for commenting a line back in.

This short cut also works for multiline comments. Simply highlight all the lines you'd
like to comment out and do the same: `command` + `/`.
